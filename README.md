# MasterFighter

During a challenging team project spanning eight nights in my programming bootcamp, we created a simple but exciting game inspired by the Street Fighter franchise, but with a Code For All_ twist.

Our team used our, at the time, limited programming knowledge along with the "Simple Graphics GFX" library to develop this multiplayer game.

This project not only improved my technical skills in Java programming and graphical user interface design but also reinforced the importance of teamwork and collaboration in achieving common goals.
